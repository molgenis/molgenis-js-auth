There are a few tasks which need to be performed by all of the roles defined for the authentication part.

### Request access
In most of the networks we delegate the authentication process to the ID-providers of the institute. We can define 2 authentication services which have institutes already subscribed to their services.

One is on a national level: [SRAM](https://sbs.sram.surf.nl/). The other one is [ELIXIR](https://login.elixir-czech.org/). Which is used in Europe.

To acquire an account you need to login via ELIXIR.
